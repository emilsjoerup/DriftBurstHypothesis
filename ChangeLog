  *DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 0.1.1
  *Fix ambiguity in a call to sqrt() for int which caused installation failure on Solaris.
  *More robust code, passing vectors of differing length for logprices and time are now stopped.
  *The Mu and Sigma vectors returned now also start with a 0 instead of uninitiated memory.
  *Documentation changed to make it more clear that the left-sided exponential kernel is used (no foresight).

  *DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 0.1.2
  *Fix a bug where the iMaxLag was being scaled higher if the lag selection algorithm suggested a lag higher than 20.
  *Add xts funcitonality, now an xts object will no longer break the code and the timestamps can now be extracted from and xts.

  DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 0.1.3
  *Implement tests for function that is prone to cause failures (Automatic Lag Selection Algorithm)
  *Put in safeguard that should prevent crashes. Now, it is not allowed to have more than 15 minutes between trades.
  *Fix bug caused by a misunderstanding when re-reading the paper. The bug was introduced in version 0.1.2 caused too low maximum lags

  *New plot method for the "DBH" S3 class also introduced in this version
  *New methods getMu and getSigma to get the mu and sigma estimates

  *New method getDH to get the Drift Bursts test statistic added.
