  *DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 0.1.1
  *Fix ambiguity in a call to sqrt() for int which caused installation failure on Solaris.
  *More robust code, passing vectors of differing length for logprices and time are now stopped.
  *The Mu and Sigma vectors returned now also start with a 0 instead of uninitiated memory.
  *Documentation changed to make it more clear that the left-sided exponential kernel is used (no foresight).

  *DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 0.1.2
  *Fix a bug where the iMaxLag was being scaled higher if the lag selection algorithm suggested a lag higher than 20. (Was a bug now fixed)
  *Add xts funcitonality, now an xts object will no longer break the code and the timestamps can now be extracted from and xts.

  *Mitigate bug that caused crashes if the first testing time was before actual observations.
2019-13-04 Emil Sjoerup <emilsjoerup@live.dk>
  *Update documentation to get ready for CRAN update.

  DESCRIPTION (Version): New version is 0.1.3
  *Implement tests for function that is prone to cause failures (Automatic Lag Selection Algorithm)
  *Put in safeguard that should prevent crashes. Now, it is not allowed to have more than 15 minutes between trades.
  *Fix bug caused by a misunderstanding when re-reading the paper. The bug was introduced in version 0.1.2 caused too low maximum lags
2019-14-05 Emil Sjoerup <emilsjoerup@live.dk>
  *New plot method for the "DBH" S3 class also introduced in this version
  *New methods getMu and getSigma to get the mu and sigma estimates
2019-06-06 Emil Sjoerup <emilsjoerup@live.dk>
  *New method getDB to get the Drift Bursts test statistic added.
2019-06-14 Emil Sjoerup <emilsjoerup@live.dk>
  *add timezones to the code, output should no longer have timezones different from the input
2019-06-24 Emil Sjoerup <emilsjoerup@live.dk>
  *Fix a mistake that lead to foresight in the lag selection algorithm
  *More helpful messages
2019-06-25 Emil Sjoerup <emilsjoerup@live.dk>
  *Allow for different time-zones in plotting. The standard is that a trading day starts at 9:30
2019-06-30 Emil Sjoerup <emilsjoerup@live.dk>
  *Use warnings instead of cat() to display warnings
  *Start loop at first test time instead of second in case users don't use same testtimes as I do.
  *getMu() and getSigma() now returns corrected values (i.e. mu * Mean_bandwidth, and sigma * 2 * iT)
2019-07-06 Emil Sjoerup <emilsjoerup@live.dk>
  *Bump version number to 0.1.3.1
  *Don't start loop at first test time, instead make it explicit in the documentation that the first test is not calculated and should be used to designate the start of the trading day.
  *Add tests for the examples given.
2019-08-22 Emil Sjoerup <emilsjoerup@live.dk>
  *Change to camelCase
  *getMu and getSigma now corrects for nObs
